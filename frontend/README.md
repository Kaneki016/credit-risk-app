# Frontend (React)

This folder contains the Vite + React frontend for the credit-risk-app.

Quick start (from repository root):

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend expects the API webhook to be available at the URL configured in `config.py` (default: `http://localhost:5678/webhook/...`).
